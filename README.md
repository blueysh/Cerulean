Cerulean is the utility plugin for server admins who need a simple solution that doesn't bloat their server with unnecessary commands and features. Each feature is individually customizable and toggleable, and features that you disable don't get loaded, meaning that the plugin won't register things it's been told not to.

#### Cerulean is still in development and more features will constantly be added. Pull requests and feature requests are welcome!

### What features does it have?
- Player Logging (Join & Quit Messages)
- Invsee
- Fly
- Damaging
- Unsigned Chat Messaging Options
- More on the way! (Also taking PRs and feature requests)
